# Flask-API

This repo contains the python files in the public api I created with PythonAnyWhere.com

# Disease Predictor

The following models have been trained from datasets obtained from kaggle.Various Regression models have been utilised to optimise the memory usage and accuracy.The trained models have been converted into APIs using flask library.The pickled ml models have not been included in the repository due space constraints, however they could all be generated by running the python files inside from the folder(Not necessary since they have already been deployed ).Google Cloud Platform has been used to deploy the API.The AMD instance that has been utilised is that of N2D(machine type: n2d-standard-2 ,CPU platform: AMD Rome,Architecture:x86/64).The VM instance will be temporarily suspended after the submission of the projects(April 16) to prevent being overcharged for the deployment services. Therefore API calls to the provided endpoints will not be valid.Given below is the column names of the data on which models have been trained.

 'MDVP:RAP',
 'Jitter:DDP',
 'PPE',
 'NHR',
 'spread1',
 'spread2']


description of each parameter

MDVP:Fo(Hz): This parameter measures the fundamental frequency of the voice, which is the lowest frequency in the harmonic spectrum of the voice.

MDVP:Fhi(Hz): This parameter measures the highest frequency in the harmonic spectrum of the voice.

MDVP:Flo(Hz): This parameter measures the lowest frequency in the harmonic spectrum of the voice.

MDVP:Jitter(Abs): This parameter measures the variation in the time between consecutive glottal closures, which can indicate irregularities in the vocal cords.

MDVP:RAP: This parameter measures the average absolute difference between consecutive glottal closure periods.

Jitter:DDP: This parameter measures the average absolute difference between adjacent pairs of glottal closure periods.

PPE: This parameter stands for Pitch Period Entropy, and it measures the randomness of the pitch periods in the voice signal.

NHR: This parameter measures the ratio of noise in the signal to the harmonic components of the voice.

spread1: This parameter measures the nonlinear dynamic complexity of the speech signal.

spread2: This parameter measures the nonlinear dynamic complexity of the speech signal.
